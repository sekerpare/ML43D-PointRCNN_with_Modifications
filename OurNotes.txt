Paper:
PointRCNN: 3D Object Proposal Generation and Detection from Point Cloud(CVPR 2019)
Dataset:
- KITTI dataset
Modifications:
• Use focal loss function for bin-based box generation (Niyazi)
• Use soft NMS or weighted NMS algorithm for removing redundant proposals (Onur)
• Use RoIAlign or PointAlign for point cloud region pooling method (Tolunay)
• Use VoteNet as a backbone network for point cloud feature extraction (Alican)
